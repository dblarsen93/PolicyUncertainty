    '''
    This function finds confidence bands for data from the Monte Carlo
    simulations.  It also plots predictions and with confidence bands, and 
    predictions versus the final simulation as an example.
    
    Inputs:
    -----------  
    mcdata: a list of numpy arrays with simulations in the rows and
        observations in the columns
    preddata: a list of 1-dimensional numpy arrays for the period zero
        predictions from the model
    bardata: a list of steady state values from the baseline
    histdata: a list of 1-dimensional numpy arrays for the final simulation 
    name: a string that is used when saving the plots and other files
    nsim: the number of Monte Carlo simulations that have been run
    
    Outputs:
    -----------  
    avgdata: list of 1-dimensional numpy arrays containing the average values 
        from the simulations for each time period
    uppdata: list of 1-dimensional numpy arrays containing the upper confidence
        bands from the simulations for each time period
    lowdata: list of 1-dimensional numpy arrays containing the lower confidence
        bands from the simulations for each time period
