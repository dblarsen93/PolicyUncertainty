Abstract
========
This code repository stores Data files and Python code for "On the Forecasting Accuracy of DSGE Solution Methods under Uncertainty."

This paper examines the forecasting accuracy of three different model solution methods: value-function iteration, linearization about the steady state, and the generalized stochastic simulation algorithm (GSSA) of Judd, Mailiar and Maliar (2011).  We compare the cost of computing the forecasts and the forecast accuracy across these methods for a three simple models.
